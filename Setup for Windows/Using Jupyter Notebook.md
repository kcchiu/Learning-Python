###Installation  
There are two ways to install **Jupyter Notebook**:  
####1. Install using **Anaconda** and **Conda**  
  For new users, we highly recommend [installing Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.  
####2. Alternative for experienced Python users: Installing Jupyter with pip  
  As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Pythonâ€™s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.  
  First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:  
  ```
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
  Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:  
  ```
  pip install jupyter
  ```
